# Play & Mine (P2M) Prototype

Welcome to the P2M Prototype! This is the early concept of our revolutionary app that turns gamers' PCs into a mining and computing pool, powered by AI.

## What is P2M?
P2M unites thousands of GPUs into a massive pool for mining altcoins (Monero, ETC) and computing tasks (rendering, AI). Our AI-agent optimizes power usage and picks the most profitable tasks in real-time.

## Current Features
- `p2m_agent.py`: A Python script simulating the AI-agent:
  - Adjusts GPU power (20%-100%) based on usage and temp.
  - Chooses between mining (Monero, ETC, Ravencoin) and computing (rendering).
  - Outputs hashrate and profit.

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/PlayAndMine/P2M-prototype.git`
3. Run: `python p2m_agent.py`
4. See the AI in action!

## Next Steps
- Integrate real mining (xmrig) and computing (Golem SDK).
- Connect to Somnia EVM for token payouts.
- Scale to 100+ PCs for real hashrate (500 MH/s+).
